Two of the nodes of a Binary Search Tree (BST) are swapped. Fix (or correct) the BST by swapping them back. Do not change the structure of the tree.
Expected Time Complexity : O(n)

Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
10 5 8 2 20 (20 and 8 should be replaced)
11 3 17 N 4 10 (11 and 10 should be replaced)

Output:
1
1
