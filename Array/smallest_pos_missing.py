You are given an array arr[] of N integers including 0. The task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array.
Note: Expected solution in O(n) time using constant extra space.
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
0 -10 1 3 -20
Output:
6
2

# use Index to keep check of smallest positive

# then mark visited places as -ve. It number on any index is +ve means that +ve number is not found
